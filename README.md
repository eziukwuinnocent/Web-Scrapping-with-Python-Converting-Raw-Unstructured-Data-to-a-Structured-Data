This project involved a comprehensive collection of customer feedback data for British Airways (BA) from a third-party review platform. The objective was to extract raw unstructured web data, and transform it into structured (tabular) data for future analysis and to uncover insights into customers' sentiments regarding various aspects of their flight experiences.
